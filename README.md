## Overview  
*Just Puzzles* is an online source for puzzles that takes an image and breaks it up into the number of pieces and piece shape specified by the user. As the admin, I can upload many images ahead of time and have them released upon the date given to each image for a hands-off daily update. The puzzle mechanics and image selections were designed to create a enjoyable, relaxing and satisfying user experience.
